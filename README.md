Classification Method Used
Passive Aggressive Classifier (PAC)
This algorithm is slightly similar to a Perceptron model, but it doesn't need any learning rate, but it does include a regularization parameter. The two words passive and aggressive have different meanings in context to this algorithm; passive means if the prediction is correct, then keep the model without making any changes to it, and aggressive means if the prediction is wrong then make some changes to the model and correct it.

The core concept to use this classifier is because this classifier adjusts its weight vector for each misclassified training sample it receives, trying to get it correct.
